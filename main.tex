% I wanted a more consistent way of creating CVs/resumes,
% so I made a few environments for adding content.
% There's {education}, {research_exp}, and {employment}.
% They take certain arguments, such as start and end dates,
% which are automatically placed into position on the

% on your CV.
% Publications are rendered with \fullcite, which pulls

	\textbf{Research}\\
	\begin{research_exp}{February 2017}{August 2019}{Signal--Background Discrimination in EXO--200}{University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL}{Igor Ostrovskiy}
		\begin{itemize}
    	    \item I trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for recognizing neutrinoless double beta decay signals against background events. I found that they had higher accuracy than conventional methods, such as binary decision trees, in my preliminary results.
    	    \item I administered two Linux GPU computing servers. My duties included managing user accounts, data, hardware, and software on these systems.
    	    \item I worked on statistically interpreting an event-by-event classifier (e.g., a CNN) to calculate the sensitivity of the method and confidence intervals.
    	    \item I gained experience working with photomultiplier tubes and digitizers for a muon detection project.
        \end{itemize}
	\end{research_exp}
    
    \begin{research_exp}{May 2019}{July 2019}{Neutrino Physics REU}{Duke University, Durham, NC}{Kate Scholberg}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I searched for candidates for neutrino detector materials based on their charged--current interaction energy thresholds.
            \item I found two isotopes, $^{181}$Ta and $^{160}$Gd, that have desirable properties. I ran preliminary calculations for interaction cross sections and event rates, greenlighting further study.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{research_exp}
    
    \begin{research_exp}{May 2018}{August 2018}{Experimental Nuclear Structure REU}{Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN}{Joseph Hamilton}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Using double and triple coincidence counting, I measured the frequency at which $^{252}$Cf spontaneously fissions into certain isotopes. I performed these measurements for two separate element pairs: tellurium--palladium and strontium--neodymium.
            \item I tabulated my results into yields matrices, finding that the most common number of neutrons evaporated during these decays was 3 or 4, with immeasurably small yields above 5 neutrons. This is evidence that a previously studied case, that of barium--molybdenum, is unique since it has an unusually high probability of evaporating between 7 and 10 neutrons.
        \end{itemize}

	    I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant in introductory physics courses from the spring of my freshman year until my senior year. I assisted with labs, proctored exams, and presented extra credit problems for the classes.
